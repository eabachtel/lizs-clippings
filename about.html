                <h1>Rooted in Real Life</h1>
                <p>Wild & Rooted is a tiny plant business with a big heart, built between school runs, work calls, and late night repotting sessions.</p>

                <h2>The Story</h2>
            </header>
            <div class="text-block">
                <p>Wild & Rooted started as a way to turn a love of plants into something that could help support a family while also giving other people small pockets of calm. The clippings in the shop are grown, trimmed, and packed with care in Jacksonville, North Carolina.</p>
                <p>Every order is touched by a real person, not a warehouse line. You are getting plants that have been fussed over, talked to, and sometimes moved three times to find the right window.</p>

            </header>
            <div class="text-block">
                <p>Wild & Rooted is dedicated to the women who quietly move mountains. The moms, stepmoms, caregivers, and friends who keep the house running and still make room for small beauty.</p>
                <p>This shop is a reminder that you get to have things that are just for you. A vine on your bookshelf. A bright leaf on the counter. A soft bit of green that feels like breathing room.</p>

            </header>
            <div class="text-block">
                <p>Behind the scenes, there is a kid who helps pick out which leaves look the happiest, and a partner who hauls soil bags and wood planks for future greenhouse dreams. This is a family project, and every order helps move those dreams a little closer.</p>
                <p>Wild & Rooted is especially grateful for the support, patience, and encouragement from the people who said "try it" when it felt scary. This page is quietly dedicated to them, and to one very loved kid who reminds us daily that growth is never a straight line.</p>
